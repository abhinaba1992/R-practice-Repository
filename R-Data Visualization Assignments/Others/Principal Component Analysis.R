#Rough steps for achieving the same: (from an implementation perspective these steps are in a way that we implement in R
#and the same would vary in Python)
#1. Data cleaning: Missing value imputation, NA removal, dummification and converting the object/factor/categorical  
#   variables to integer variables since PCA works only on integer vars.
#2. Splitting the data into train and test.
#3. Scaling or standardisation followed by finding the principal components. We would get:
#a. scale(standard deviation), 
#b. center(mean), 
#c. rotation(principal component loading vector:its the Components and the variable values explained by each component), 
#d. x(this would give us the correlation matrix of principal component score vectors in a 8523 × 44 dimension )
#4. Plotting the resultant Principal Components 
#5. Calculate Standard Deviation followed by Variance for each principal component.
#6. Checking the explained variance ratio
#7. Plotting a scree plot to find the number of principal components that expalins most of the variation in the data
#8. Plotting a cumulative scree plot for better understanding of the principal components
#9. Appending our obtained PCA data(the data obtained in step 3.d) with the main data frame target variable column 
#   and runnning the respective algorithm of our choice
#10. Testing the the model for prediction and errors

#Scaling the values or doing standardisation

#The prcomp() function results in 5 useful measures:

#1. center and scale refers to respective mean and standard deviation of the variables 
#that are used for normalization prior to implementing PCA

#outputs the mean of variables
prin_comp$center

#outputs the standard deviation of variables
prin_comp$scale

#2. The rotation measure provides the principal component loading. Each column of rotation
#matrix contains the principal component loading vector. This is the most important measure we should be interested in.

prin_comp$rotation

#This returns 44 principal components loadings coz in a data set, the maximum number of principal component loadings is a
#minimum of (n-1, p).#44 components are returned because the same is the total number of cols/features after dummification 

#Let's look at first 4 principal components and first 5 rows.

prin_comp$rotation[1:5,1:4]

#3. In order to compute the principal component score vector, we don't need to multiply the loading with data. Rather, the 
#matrix x has the principal component score vectors in a 8523 × 44 dimension.
