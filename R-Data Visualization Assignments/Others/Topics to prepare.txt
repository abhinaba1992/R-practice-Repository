Time Series
-------------
* Read Stationary details along with acf and pacf details.

Linear Regression
-------------------
* Mathematically how it works i.e.; how Betas are selected.
* Local Optima Vs GLobal Optima.
* What do you mean by High variance in the data.
* What is the standard error.
* How is T-Statistics calculated. (Not asked, but we need to check it)
* Why do the errors need to be normally distributed.

Logistic Regression 
--------------------
* How exactly are the betas selected.
* How do they do the predictions using the MLE function.
* How to check variance in respect of the target variable.
